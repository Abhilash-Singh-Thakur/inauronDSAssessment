    "Ans - Cassandra ensures high availability and fault tolerance in a distributed database system through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: Cassandra uses a peer-to-peer distributed architecture where data is replicated across multiple nodes. Each node in the cluster holds a copy of the data, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. Replication can be configured to replicate data across multiple data centers for additional resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent Hashing: Cassandra uses consistent hashing to distribute data across the cluster. This ensures that each node in the cluster is responsible for a specific range of data, allowing for efficient read and write operations. Consistent hashing also helps in maintaining data distribution and load balancing as nodes are added or removed from the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication Factor: Cassandra allows configuring the replication factor, which determines the number of replicas for each piece of data. By having multiple replicas, Cassandra ensures that data remains available even if some nodes fail. Replicas can be placed on different physical nodes, racks, or data centers to provide fault tolerance and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Repair: Cassandra periodically performs anti-entropy repairs to reconcile differences between replicas and ensure data consistency. This repair process identifies inconsistencies and synchronizes data across replicas to maintain data integrity and prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gossip Protocol: Cassandra uses a gossip protocol for node discovery and failure detection. Nodes in the cluster communicate with each other, exchanging information about their status and the status of other nodes. This allows Cassandra to detect and respond to node failures quickly, ensuring high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunable Consistency: Cassandra provides tunable consistency, allowing users to trade off consistency for availability or vice versa based on their application requirements. Consistency levels can be set at the request level, allowing developers to choose the desired level of consistency for each operation.\n",
