# ğŸ’¡ **Question 1**

# Given a string `s`, *find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index*. If it does not exist, return `-1`.
# Example: Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: 0

# Solution

def firstUniqChar(s):
    char_count = [0] * 26  # array to store the frequency count of each character

    # Update the frequency count of each character
    for char in s:

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 2**

# Given aÂ **circular integer array**Â `nums`Â of lengthÂ `n`, returnÂ *the maximum possible sum of a non-emptyÂ **subarray**Â of*Â `nums`.

# AÂ **circular array**Â means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. Formally, the next element ofÂ `nums[i]`Â isÂ `nums[(i + 1) % n]`Â and the previous element ofÂ `nums[i]`Â isÂ `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]`.

# AÂ **subarray**Â may only include each element of the fixed bufferÂ `nums`Â at most once. Formally, for a subarrayÂ `nums[i], nums[i + 1], ..., nums[j]`, there does not existÂ `i <= k1`,Â `k2 <= j`Â withÂ `k1 % n == k2 % n`.

# Solution

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 3**

# The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbersÂ `0`Â andÂ `1`Â respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

# The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in aÂ **stack**. At each step:

# - If the student at the front of the queueÂ **prefers**Â the sandwich on the top of the stack, they willÂ **take it**Â and leave the queue.
# - Otherwise, they willÂ **leave it**Â and go to the queue's end.

# This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

# You are given two integer arraysÂ `students`Â andÂ `sandwiches`Â whereÂ `sandwiches[i]`Â is the type of theÂ `ith`Â sandwich in the stack (`i = 0`Â is the top of the stack) andÂ `students[j]`Â is the preference of theÂ `jth`Â student in the initial queue (`j = 0`Â is the front of the queue). ReturnÂ *the number of students that are unable to eat.*

# **Example 1:**

def count_students_unable_to_eat(students, sandwiches):
    unable_to_eat = 0
    n = len(students)
    i = 0
    
    while i < n:

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 4**

# You have aÂ `RecentCounter`Â class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

# Implement theÂ `RecentCounter`Â class:

# - `RecentCounter()`Â Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
# - `int ping(int t)`Â Adds a new request at timeÂ `t`, whereÂ `t`Â represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the pastÂ `3000`Â milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive rangeÂ `[t - 3000, t]`.

# It isÂ **guaranteed**Â that every call toÂ `ping`Â uses a strictly larger value ofÂ `t`Â than the previous call.

# **Example 1:**

# Solution

class RecentCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.requests = []
        self.next_index = 0

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 5**

# There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in **clockwise order**. More formally, moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the `1st` friend.

# The rules of the game are as follows:

# 1. **Start** at the `1st` friend.
# 2. Count the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction **including** the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
# 3. The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
# 4. If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step `2` **starting** from the friend **immediately clockwise** of the friend who just lost and repeat.
# 5. Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

# Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return *the winner of the game*.

# Solution 

def find_winner(n, k):
    friends = list(range(1, n + 1))
    current = 0
    
    while len(friends) > 1:
        current = (current + k - 1) % len(friends)

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 6**

# You are given an integer array `deck`. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the `ith` card is `deck[i]`.

# You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

# You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

# 1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
# 2. If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
# 3. If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.

# Return *an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order*.

# **Note** that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

# **Example 1:**

# Input: deck = [1,1000]
# Output: [1,1000]

#Solution

from collections import deque

# ğŸ’¡ **Question 7**

# Design a queue that supports `push` and `pop` operations in the front, middle, and back.

# Implement the `FrontMiddleBack` class:

# - `FrontMiddleBack()` Initializes the queue.
# - `void pushFront(int val)` Adds `val` to the **front** of the queue.
# - `void pushMiddle(int val)` Adds `val` to the **middle** of the queue.
# - `void pushBack(int val)` Adds `val` to the **back** of the queue.
# - `int popFront()` Removes the **front** element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `1`.
# - `int popMiddle()` Removes the **middle** element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `1`.
# - `int popBack()` Removes the **back** element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `1`.

# **Notice** that when there are **two** middle position choices, the operation is performed on the **frontmost** middle position choice. For example:

# - Pushing `6` into the middle of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `[1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]`.
# - Popping the middle from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` returns `3` and results in `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.
# - `5, 6]`.

# For a stream of integers, implement a data structure that checks if the lastÂ `k`Â integers parsed in the stream areÂ **equal**Â toÂ `value`.

# Implement theÂ **DataStream**Â class:

# - `DataStream(int value, int k)`Â Initializes the object with an empty integer stream and the two integersÂ `value`Â andÂ `k`.
# - `boolean consec(int num)`Â AddsÂ `num`Â to the stream of integers. ReturnsÂ `true`Â if the lastÂ `k`Â integers are equal toÂ `value`, andÂ `false`Â otherwise. If there are less thanÂ `k`Â integers, the condition does not hold true, so returnsÂ `false`.
